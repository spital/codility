# codility

This should be a place for Codility examples/lessons, but as I do not want to spoil the pleasure of solving those brain teasers for others, I decided not to publish solutions. Task descriptions are protected by copyright.

You can find [all Codility lessons here](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/1-iterations/)

Interesting [challenges here](https://app.codility.com/programmers/challenges/)

All Python solutions for lessons (some for challenges, some gold medals too) are available on request, Golang solutions - work in progress still.
